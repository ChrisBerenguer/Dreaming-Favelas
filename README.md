# Dreaming-Favelas
Dreaming Favelas is a photography competition for low income dwellers, with the winning photographs becoming a collection of NFTs, and the photographers getting cash prizes and royalties based on the worth of the NFTs. The effort is a collaboration between Lovecrypto and ImpactMarket, and it makes use of the Celo blockchain.



I was in charge of creating the UX/UI prototype and the web development.
